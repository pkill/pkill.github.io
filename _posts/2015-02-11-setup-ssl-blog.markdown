# Platforms getting in the way
I have been motivated to publish a blog for years. I have a lot of ideas for content but the hurdle was having to setup a cumbersome blogging platform like [Wordpress][wordpress] or a wallet buster like [Typepad](http://www.typepad.com/pricing). Blogger and tumblr are a lot more streamlined but control over the look and feel is [exasperatingly constrained](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes). I wanted more flexibility and simplicity. I wanted it to be free. A lot of [prominent](http://getbootstrap.com/) open-source projects were using [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] as their landing page with great success. They were engaging, simple designs that popped.

GitHub Pages has fantastic [documention][gh-docs]. Site generation is done with [Jekyll][jekyll-docs], a straightforward template system that I already have some experience with working on [Gitlab][gitlab]. The notion that pushing changes to the upstream remote is the last step in the publishing process and drafts get committed to branches has incredible appeal.

I was floored with how quickly the first iteration of my blog came together. It was online in five minutes. My positive experience serves as an appropriate initial post. I'll share the steps I took to get the blog online and minor hurdles I experienced along the way.


# Requirements

# Go ahead, register a domain

# If you have a Github you're 90% done

# Why SSL terminate?

# Cloudflare's site performance features

# Discussion

# Analysis

# Custom 404 pages
