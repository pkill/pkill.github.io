## What's in a name?

### Things that are strictly usernames
+ First name and/or surname
+ Nickname
+ Mother's maiden name
+ Father's High School / your High School / name of first pet
+ Iris scan
+ Fingerprint or palmprint
+ DNA
+ Account number
+ Birthday
+ Blood type
+ Voice print
+ Written signature
+ Social Security Number (You should avoid giving this out at all costs)

### Things that can be passwords
+ ATM pin or security pin
+ Google or Duo 2-factor-auth code
+ RSA secure-id
+ Randomly generated passphrase
+ Passphrase for private key
+ A string of characters
+ RFID token (if it can be changed at-will)

### Things that are not usernames nor passwords
+ Private or public encryption keys in a PKI scheme
+ Salts
+ Certificates
+ Session keys
+ "Passwords" that cannot be changed at-will

## Promoting biometric information as passwords is a dangerous trend
Apple is guilty of this.
