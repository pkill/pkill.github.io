Hello
========
I'm Alex Elman. The first time I was on the Internet was in [1995](https://i.imgur.com/PK4irYz.jpg). What a time to be alive. There was this service that helped you get online. Let's call them America Online. It was such a horrible experience that I nearly [quit](https://i.imgur.com/koL8uNm.gifv) the Internet forever. I had to write a letter of apology in order to have my service reinstated... on several occasions. I found a boutique ISP in my hometown and begged my parents for proper [dial-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access) service.

My buddies and I all had our own computers in junior high. We should [not have had computers](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=script+kiddie) in junior high.

In high school my best friend and I started a [web design firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_corporation). We were a scrappy outfit and offered services that utilized bleeding edge technologies such as [Flash](http://archive.hi-res.net/donniedarko/) and CSS. Also, a word of advice: never promise clients a year of maintenance work heading into your first year of college.

I graduated from [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu) with concentrations in Nuclear Engineering and Computer Engineering. An internship brought me to Austin, Texas and I couldn't bring myself to leave.

Professionally, I work on [server automation](https://puppetlabs.com/) and [site reliability](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-traits-of-great-site-reliability-engineers) for a well-established dot-com. In my personal life I indulge in food, music, rock climbing, travelling, and [street art](https://i.imgur.com/jR6AaDf.jpg).

I have this candle adorned with the enigmatic visage of [Nikola Tesla](https://www.ted.com/talks/marco_tempest_the_electric_rise_and_fall_of_nikola_tesla) on my desk. It serves as a reminder that without him, we would need a lot more candles. It also reminds me that we stand on the shoulders of giants. I acknowledge that my personal accomplishments are built upon the brilliant work of countless other people.
